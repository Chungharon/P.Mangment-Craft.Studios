Description
B2C (Business-to-Consumer)
Students (consumers) directly hire freelancers for personal academic projects. Fast, affordable, and transparent one-on-one gigs.
B2B (Business-to-Business)
Universities, research labs, and academic departments bulk-purchase verified freelancer services for student cohorts, capstone programs, or grant-funded research support.
C2B (Consumer-to-Business)
Freelancers (students, graduates, professors) offer specialized skills (e.g., SPSS analysis, LaTeX formatting, medical case studies) and set their rates, enabling reverse bidding and skill monetization.
